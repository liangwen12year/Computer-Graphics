Note: Recommend using the Chrome browser to test my weekly project. Because I find that the IE browser can not support the API( WebGL) I use and keeps prompting up errors of the library I import, can not show my weekly project correctly.

manual:
1.	Button ¡°parallel ¡± and ¡° perspective ¡± corresponding to the different parallel projection and different perspective projection. And button ¡°Animation¡± corresponding the animation of my 3D dream house. Button ¡°additional camera¡± corresponding the additional view point of the viewer/camera, under which you could slide the slides to change the ¡°cameraAngle¡± and ¡°cameraHeight¡±.
2.	After click each button, you could choose different Textures (House1, House2) in ¡°Texture¡± option field.
3.	After click the ¡°parallel¡± button, you could choose different ¡°parallel view¡± in ¡°parallel view¡± field; and after click the ¡°perspective¡± button, you could choose different ¡°perspective view¡± in ¡°perspective view¡± field. And choose different Texture in ¡°Texture¡± option field. Then slide the slide to see the transformation and change of the view point/camera angle and the shininess of the light, as well as construct arbitrary combination of the red, green, blue light.


report:
did in week1:
1.	Modeling: draw three 2D ¡°elevation¡±, and apply 2D transformation

 did in week2:
2.	Transform object: apply 3D (Translate/Rotate/Scale/SHear) transformations to the created object.
3.	Viewing: view your created object from multiple views.
4.	Transform camera/viewer
5.	 Generate different projections of the objects (refer to class discussions about different projections)
6.	Edit/Change perspective projection vanishing points (1, 2, 3).
7.	Create texture for the object. (I draw the image first, then put the image on each side of the 3D Object)
 did in week3:
8.	Add light source to 3D object and allow user to change the shininess of the light.
9.	Animation of my 3D object.
10.	Additional camera view point.

All of the following is what I did In week 4:
11.	Add another texture to my 3D object, so right now I have two texture option---old one and new one (see my interface, Textures: House1, House2)
12.	Add red light, green light, blue light lighting effect to my 3D Object, with the combination of the red light, green light, blue light, we can construct any color of light we want (slide the slides in my interface to change the combination of the red light, green light, blue light, you will see the result)

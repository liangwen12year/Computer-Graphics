Note: Recommend using the Chrome browser to test my weekly project. Because I find that the IE browser can not support the API( WebGL) I use and keeps prompting up errors of the library I import, can not show my weekly project correctly.

manual:
1. Button ¡°parallel ¡± and ¡° perspective ¡± corresponding to the parallel projection and perspective projection.
2. After click the ¡°parallel¡± button, you could choose different ¡°parallel view¡± in ¡°parallel view¡± field; and after click the ¡°perspective¡± button, you could choose different ¡°perspective view¡± in ¡°perspective view¡± field.
3. Then slide the slide to see the transformation and change of the view point etc.

report:
1. Modeling: draw three 2D ¡°elevation¡±, and apply 2D transformation(did in week1)
All of the following is what I did in week2:
2. Transform object: apply 3D (Translate/Rotate/Scale/SHear) transformations to the created object.
3. Viewing: view your created object from multiple views.
4. Transform camera/viewer
5. Generate different projections of the objects (refer to class discussions about different projections)
6. Edit/Change perspective projection vanishing points (1, 2, 3).
7. Create texture for the object. (I draw the image first, then put the image on each side of the 3D Object)

line, polyline:
you just need to click on the canvas then you can get  the primitive of interest.

circle: 
first click indicates the center of the circle, the second click indicates radius of the circle.


rectangle:
the first and second click indicates the diagonal vertex of the rectangle.

polygon:
after click several times on the canvas, you can click "show polygon", then you can get the polygon.

elipse:
Actually, it was almost impossible to use "click" to indicate the two radius of the elipse in reality. So I choose to pass parameter instead.
elipse(x),elipse(y) indicates the center of the elipse. elipse(rx),elipse(ry) indicates two radius of elipse. After pass in the parameter click 
"show elipse", then you can get the elipse.


Button "line","circle","elipse","rectangle","polygon","polyline" could be used as the link to the designated html page, and also function 
as the erase button or refresh button.
